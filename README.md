# A Senseable Python Template

![Docs](https://github.com/daydemir/senseable-python-template/actions/workflows/deploy-docs.yml/badge.svg)

This documentation provides guidance on best practices for Python projects at the MIT Senseable City Lab. This guide is built on top of the existing work done by the DrivenData team that built the widely adopted [cookiecutter-data-science](https://cookiecutter-data-science.drivendata.org) template. As stated in their documentation, this template provides: 

> *A logical, flexible, and reasonably standardized project structure for doing and sharing data science work.*

It is recommended that you read about [the opinions reflected in the template](https://cookiecutter-data-science.drivendata.org/opinions/), and use them to guide your own work and to inform any choice to deviate from the recommended structure.
