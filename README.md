# Senseable Template

This template is a starting point for researchers who want to publish the code they have written for their research. 

There are essentially three ways to publish your code so it can be reused (and potentially cited):

1. Publish the code as is
2. Publish a Python package
3. Publish as peer-reviewed software

If you hope to do either (2) or (3), this template provides some guidance on how to structure your code for package deployment and for peer review. If you only plan to do (1), this can still be a useful template to get started with.
