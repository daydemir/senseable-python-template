# [DRAFT] A Senseable Python Template

![Docs](https://github.com/daydemir/senseable-python-template/actions/workflows/deploy-docs.yml/badge.svg)

## Motivation

This guide provides recommendations for how to structure Python projects developed within the MIT Senseable City Lab, and has the following goals in mind:

1. Remove friction to get started with Python projects
2. Improve internal code reuse and reproducibility
3. Centralize access to shared resources
4. Make it easier to publish code publicly

## Overview

This documentation provides guidance on best practices for Python projects at the MIT Senseable City Lab. This guide is built on top of the existing work done by the DrivenData team that created the widely adopted [cookiecutter-data-science](https://cookiecutter-data-science.drivendata.org) template. As stated in their documentation, this template provides: 

> *A logical, flexible, and reasonably standardized project structure for doing and sharing data science work.*

It is recommended that you read about [the opinions reflected in the template](https://cookiecutter-data-science.drivendata.org/opinions/), and use them to guide your own work and to inform any choice to deviate from the recommended structure.

**To get started with the Senseable Python Template, [visit the homepage](https://daydemir.github.io/senseable-python-template/).**

## Improvements
- Add instructions for how to integrate your work with the SCL BIZON Workstation and NAS
- Provide some example usage or boilerplate for processing common types of imagery (possibly using libraries like [Zen SVI](https://zensvi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/))
- Add offboarding instructions for researchers who are leaving the lab
